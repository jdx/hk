# Haul Away, HK

*A sea shanty celebrating the hk git hook manager*

## Verse 1

> Oh, gather 'round me hearties, let me tell you of a tool,<br>
> That keeps your commits shipshape and follows every rule,<br>
> With hooks that catch your errors 'fore they sail into the main,<br>
> HK's the trusty captain keeping order on your lane!<br>

## Chorus

> **Heave ho! Check your code!**<br>
> **HK runs while the wind has blowed!**<br>
> **Lint and format, test and verify,**<br>
> **No bugs will slip past this captain's eye!**<br>

## Verse 2

> She's built with Rust, me mateys, fast as dolphins in the deep,<br>
> While other tools are sleeping, she never needs her sleep,<br>
> In parallel she's running, all hands upon the deck,<br>
> Your pre-commit hooks flying, keeping code safe from all wreck!<br>

*(Chorus)*

## Verse 3

> With Pkl for navigation, your config charts the course,<br>
> And mise-en-place beside her, a steadfast faithful force,<br>
> She battens down the hatches on your staged and unstaged files,<br>
> And guides your code to harbor across a thousand miles!<br>

*(Chorus)*

## Final Verse

> So raise a glass to HK, the finest hook there be,<br>
> From pre-commit to pre-push, she guards our code with glee,<br>
> Install her with your mise tool, just "mise use hk",<br>
> And sail into production on a bright and bug-free day!<br>

## Final Chorus

> **Heave ho! Ship the code!**<br>
> **HK guards the precious load!**<br>
> **From the hook unto the main,**<br>
> **We'll never fear a bug again!**<br>
