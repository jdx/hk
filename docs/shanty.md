# The Ballad of HK

*A sea shanty celebrating the hk git hook manager*

## Verse 1

> Oh, gather 'round me hearties, let me tell you of a tool,
> That keeps your commits shipshape and follows every rule,
> With hooks that catch your errors 'fore they sail into the main,
> HK's the trusty captain keeping order on your lane!

## Chorus

> **Heave ho! Check your code!**
> **HK runs while the wind has blowed!**
> **Lint and format, test and verify,**
> **No bugs will slip past this captain's eye!**

## Verse 2

> She's built with Rust, me mateys, fast as dolphins in the deep,
> While other tools are sleeping, she never needs her sleep,
> In parallel she's running, all hands upon the deck,
> Your pre-commit hooks flying, keeping code safe from all wreck!

*(Chorus)*

## Verse 3

> With Pkl for navigation, your config charts the course,
> And mise-en-place beside her, a steadfast faithful force,
> She battens down the hatches on your staged and unstaged files,
> And guides your code to harbor across a thousand miles!

*(Chorus)*

## Final Verse

> So raise a glass to HK, the finest hook there be,
> From pre-commit to pre-push, she guards our code with glee,
> Install her with your mise tool, just "mise use hk",
> And sail into production on a bright and bug-free day!

## Final Chorus

> **Heave ho! Ship the code!**
> **HK guards the precious load!**
> **From the hook unto the main,**
> **We'll never fear a bug again!**
